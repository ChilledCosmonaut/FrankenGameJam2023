# Overview
MultiMouseUnity is a Unity implementation and wrapper of Mystery Wizard's [MultiMouse](https://www.sindenwiki.org/wiki/The_House_of_the_Dead_Remake) plugin to get multiple mouse devices working and usable within Unity applications.

This early version is meant for experienced Unity developers for the purpose of jumping into lightgun game development and helping test for usability issues/bugs.
